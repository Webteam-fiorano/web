                <h4>Customer Profile</h4>
                <p>Delaware North is one of the largest and most admired privately-held hospitality companies in the world. Founded and owned by the Jacobs family for nearly 100 years, it is a global leader in hospitality and food service having operations in sports, travel hospitality, restaurants and catering, parks, resorts, gaming and specialty retail industries. Its portfolio includes high-profile, international venues and events such as the Wembley Stadium, Emirates Stadium, Pride Park Stadium and the Australian Open tennis tournament. </p>
                <p>Delaware North has annual revenues of $3 billion with 60,000 employees serving half a billion guests in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia. "Delaware North" is a reference to Delaware North Companies Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries, including location-specific operating entities.</p>

                <h4>Business Problem</h4>
                <p>Historically Delaware North utilized custom point-to-point integration and batch processing of data.  Over time, the maintenance of the custom applications became difficult and costly. These high costs coupled with the need to improve business efficiencies and provide higher value information to its customers prompted Delaware North to evaluate new technology approaches. </p>
                <p>The challenge for Delaware North was to create agility and competitive advantage by delivering real-time data for its clients. The requirement called for an infrastructure of interconnected systems that is customer-centric, allows operational excellence, optimization, efficiency and differentiation for competitive advantage. The challenges faced by Delaware North include:</p>
                <ul class="pad">
                    <li><strong class="b">Unstructured data</strong> - Analyzing and presenting large volumes of unstructured data caused potential problems  </li>
                    <li><strong class="b">Manual data process</strong> - Lack of real-time automation stretched execution timelines, resulting in declining productivity</li>
                    <li><strong class="b">Lack of real-time data access</strong> - Delaware North needed a way to access real-time data and enhance the accuracy of the insights posed</li>
                    <li><strong class="b">Disparate applications</strong> - With disparate applications running at 40 odd locations globally, it was necessary to unify these systems over a distributed backbone technology</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>After a collaborative Proof of Concept with Fiorano Software, Delaware North found the Fiorano ESB platform could meet its business requirements efficiently with significant improvements in time to market. </p>
                <p>The Fiorano implementation at Delaware North provides a platform to aggregate and access data from disparate applications at over 40 locations. In addition the Fiorano implementation handles job scheduling (to scrub and transfer data between disparate sources) and provides access to its internal data by deploying REST services which perform data lookup, enrichment and transformations on demand. Fiorano is the single point of data ingress and egress for Delaware North internal systems to consume data from disparate systems. These data transfers are handled in the form of scheduled jobs (which perform business choreography tasks) and web APIs which provide on-demand access to data from systems deployed around the world. Because the infrastructure is service-oriented, Delaware North can easily make changes to any of the services, or even to the workflow, without negatively impacting other parts of the system.</p>

                <h4>Result</h4>
                <p>With a scalable, secure and reliable system in place for delivering data on a single gateway, Delaware North can now efficiently track individual customer venues and provide the Business Intelligence required in managing their business efficiently while providing a competitive edge for themselves and its customers. With the Fiorano platform in place, Delaware North can synchronize data from disparate applications with an ease and efficiency that saves time and also opens new areas of opportunity. </p>
                <p>"Our partners and clients love the speed at which we get data back to them and the near-real-time analytics it can provide. This enables them to judge the efficacy of their marketing campaigns, assess operational efficiency and make adjustments to improve top line revenues." said Scott Mercer, Manager of the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Solutions Team, Delaware North. "Fiorano professional services act as an extension to our team for both new development and support. Fiorano's development team is very responsive, with changes to functionality turned around sometimes within a week, which would be unheard of with larger vendors. This allows my team to keep our focus on architecture and design."</p>
                <p>Going forward Delaware North intends to steadily extend the ESB infrastructure across its global locations which can ready their systems for today's highly connected and digitized economy, enabling change management and responsiveness to business conditions in real time. </p>
