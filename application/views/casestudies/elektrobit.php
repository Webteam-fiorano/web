                </p>
                <h4>Business Problem</h4>
                <p>Elektrobit is using a server infrastructure based on Windows
                    Server &amp; Linux platforms. In service production they use both
                    in-house developed services as well as third party SaaS-services.  They have a large end-user base of about 1500 and
                    counting, accessing their technology across geographies and
                    time-zones.</p>
                <p>
                    In 2007, as they were planning a renewal of their financial
                    processes &amp; tools, Elektrobit realized that they required a
                    centralized messaging infrastructure which would unify the
                    existing landscape of disparate applications. The selected
                    accounting tool was a web-based SaaS-service and all
                    financial subsystems were to be integrated with it, hence a
                    web service-capable integration platform was required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the inception of the application architecture plan, Elektrobit
                    had established that an Enterprise Service Bus would be the
                    middleware solution of choice . They had decided not to
                    implement one massive ERP-solution, but rather a flexible
                    mesh of applications, where a number of old legacy
                    applications and a selection of new applications would
                    communicate simultaneously through a single integration
                    channel.</p>
                <p>
                    Their architectural blue print thus envisaged a framework
                    providing independent connectivity to all tools, enabling
                    change of business processes on-demand, without service
                    breaks. Flexible application architecture was expected to bring
                    savings in shorter implementation and change schedules.
                    An ESB would also make it possible to change tools on the
                    go, without redesigning the whole process again. Reusability
                    would bring crucial benefits for rapid application integration
                    and once developed, solutions could be easily reused in new
                    integration processes.</p>
                <p>
                    The primary goal was to find a product which would enable
                    integration of internal finance and HR tools and to return
                    transaction data from the accounting system back to the
                    reporting data warehouse.</p>
                <p>
                    They were also looking for the ability to integrate third party
                    web tools with internal systems. Working on a tight schedule,
                    Elektrobit required a flexible and easily scalable environment
                    which would reduce their time to production.</p>
                <p>
                    Further, Elektrobit did not have a dedicated middleware
                    developer on their team, and therefore required a platform
                    that was easy to learn and did not require too much training
                    for implementation. They expected highly responsive support
                    from their chosen vendor as well.</p>

                <h4>Selection Process</h4>
                <p>As the selection process was kicked-off, Elektrobit went
                    through product demos and visited several major integration
                    solution vendors. After short-listing a set of vendors, they set
                    up a Proof of Concept which required the integration of four
                    different types of applications.</p>
                <p>
                    They picked up data schemas, provided sample data files with
                    real data and gave vendors two weeks to implement the POC
                    Scenario. During the POC, Fiorano outperformed others in
                    implementation speed, performance and product support,
                    being the first vendor to provide a working solution. After
                    evaluating the results of the POC stage, Fiorano ESB was
                    selected to be the backbone for messaging and application
                    integration at Elektrobit.</p>
                Timo Impi&#246;, Specialist, Global IM explains <em>&quot;Fiorano was
                    confident of its product and backed it up with an efficiently
                    executed POC delivered in time with high quality support
                    during the process. We got all the example integrations done;
                    that experience built trust and gave us confidence in the
                    vendor from a long-term perspective.  Meanwhile, some of the
                    other POC participants could not even get the integrations
                    done despite a larger outlay of resources for the POC.&quot; </em>
                He goes on to add <em>&quot;Of course we were wondering what might
                    happen to the support quality after the deal was closed, but to
                    our pleasant surprise found that the support requests are
                    handled efficiently even afterwards.&quot;</em></p>

                <p class="text-center"> <strong >Elektrobit ESB Architecture</strong></p>

                <p>Fiorano delivered sophisticated message transformation logic,
                    customized content filtering and solid web service support
                    with XML compatibility. Being platform independent and
                    consisting of an extensive set of connectivity methods
                    enabling integration out of the box, it was an ideal choice for
                    Elektrobit. To accelerate scalability, Fiorano SOA offered
                    consistent reusability features allowing Elektrobit to use
                    components developed once across new integration flows,
                    so that servers could be quickly added without much rework
                    or performance trade-off.
                </p>
                <h4>Benefits</h4>
                <span style="color:#CC4400">1. Out of the box functionality: </span>
                <p>
                    Since Elektrobit's environment incorporated several
                    applications, there was a need for several connectivity
                    methods, message transformation, content filtering, xml
                    support and web service support, all of which were
                    provided by the Fiorano ESB. Testing was also a key
                    benefit as automated tests were generated for schemas
                    and data.</p>

                <span style="color:#CC4400">2. Flexibility: </span>
                <p>
                    The Fiorano ESB architecture allows live changes to be
                    made made to running business process without
                    interrupting any of the other services. Independent
                    applications as well as flows were modified on the go without having to re-design the whole process. This not
                    only decreased development time but also allowed
                    automated tests to be generated for schemas and
                    data flows.
                </p>
                <span style="color:#CC4400">3. Reusability: </span>
                <p>
                    Solutions once developed and tested were easily
                    re-used in new integration process flows. This became
                    a very important benefit for rapid application integration
                    as the efficiency of designing new flows increased
                    linearly. In Fiorano, most of the integration processes
                    were ready to use a few hours after the installation
                    process.
                </p>
                <span style="color:#CC4400">4. Minimal Training and Resources Required: </span>
                <p>
                    With Fiorano, there was no need for massive training or
                    a large number of senior consultants for application
                    integration. The Fiorano Studio enables a
                    drag-and-drop based approach to building integration
                    flows, hence product training required was minimal.
                    Currently only one experienced developer takes care of
                    over 40 live application integration processes.
                </p>
                <span style="color:#CC4400">5. Fast Time to Production &amp; responsiveness: </span>
                <p>
                    Even though they were working on tight project
                    schedule, Elektrobit found that Fiorano was very easy
                    to deploy and setup for internal use. It quickly
                    accommodated changes in business logic and adapted
                    the existing process to match these changes efficiently.
                </p>
                <span style="color:#CC4400">6. Product Support: </span>
                <p>
                    Due to a tight schedule and adoption of a new
                    technology, Elektrobit expected that there would be
                    heavy utilization of product support during the project
                    startup phase and further down the road in the overall
                    integration lifecycle. Elektrobit received extensive and
                    reliable support during implementation and creation of
                    application integration processes.
                </p>
