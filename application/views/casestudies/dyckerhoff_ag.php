                <p>
                    Dyckerhoff AG, a 150 years old producer of cement and concrete operating across Europe and other continents, has deployed Fiorano ESB to optimize their logistics, "just in time" operations and intelligently integrate centralized SAP systems with multiple suppliers and partners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The IT landscape of Dyckerhoff is dominated by an SAP ERP system, together with additional SAP applications and a variety of heterogeneous specialty software, including laboratory and recipe management involving data exchanges with legacy production systems. As Dyckerhoff did not have an existing internal ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) infrastructure, they made the decision to bring in an enterprise-class infrastructure solution to integrate their centralized SAP systems with multiple supplier and partner SAP systems across Europe, among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dyckerhoff evaluated various integration platforms including those from Software AG, IBM and Oracle. After a detailed Proof of Concept and careful review of the proposed offers Dyckerhoff concluded that Fiorano ESB was the best match for its requirements because of its unique distributed, asynchronous architecture.

                "The most evident advantage of Fiorano is the ability to "halt" the whole communication/choreography scenario at any state of a process for debugging. This very helpful debugging feature is implemented in Fiorano in a very intelligent manner. Under our stress tests, Fiorano has shown superiority in a majority of aspects and is the product of our choice, technically and commercially"
