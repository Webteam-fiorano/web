                    Flytxt chooses FioranoMQ for highly scalable Business-to-Consumer Mobile Messaging
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <h4>Customer Profile</h4>
                <p>Flytxt is the UK's leading provider of technology and expertise for mobile marketing and interactivity. Flytxt enables its customers - which include many big names in media, FMCG, retail, entertainment and charity - to offer interactive products and services to consumers via mobile phones, using Email and the Short Message Service (SMS) protocol. In recent years SMS has grown to be one of the most popular communication mediums, particularly amongst young people. In the UK, nearly 2 billion SMS' are sent every month.</p>
                <h4>Business Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    Flytxt's advanced messaging platform implements large-scale marketing campaigns across millions of mobile phones. As Flytxt expanded and took on more campaigns, including many advertised on prime-time TV, they needed to increase their messaging performance without forgoing their strong reputation for reliability.
                </p>
                <p>Flytxt offers a robust messaging infrastructure capable of sending emails and SMS to any UK or international mobile phone and responding intelligently to messages received back from consumers. Flytxt's clients can control and report on these services using web-based tools.</p>
                <p>During 2003 Flytxt experienced a huge increase in demand for their marketing services. In order to meet this demand Flytxt needed to improve and extend its core platform. In particular, the growth of campaigns advertised on television &ndash; often resulting in many tens of thousands of messages being received from consumers within a few seconds &ndash; necessitated a much faster architecture. "SMS is an immediate medium &ndash; consumers expect to see an instant response to any message they send," said James Harker-Syren, Flytxt's Chief Technical Officer. "Being able to offer a client an immediate response to tens or hundreds of thousands of consumers was a vital differentiator for Flytxt &ndash; we needed a scalable architecture that could receive, store, and distribute those messages."</p>
                <p>Reliability too was a key concern, as James explained: "Flytxt has a strong reputation as a highly reliable and robust service provider. It was vital to our business that we could enhance our performance whilst still maintaining the level of service our clients have come to expect."</p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    FioranoMQ provided exactly the solution that Flytxt needed. Offering a resilient and reliable architecture, coupled with blistering performance, Fiorano's file-based store was able to handle the large loads of messages Flytxt would receive in a short space of time, and distribute them immediately to the Application Servers that would then process them.
                </p>
                <p>Fiorano's provision of dynamic load balancing and failover protection also allowed Flytxt to guarantee the resilience of their messaging platform &ndash; ensuring that there would be no single point of failure enabling messaging to continue even in the event of a hardware fault.</p>
                <h4>Benefits</h4>
                <p>
                    The choice of messaging provider was vital to Flytxt, and an extensive feasibility study was performed of all of the leading suppliers. The key to this assessment study was performance, reliability and ease of integration - Fiorano was a clear leader in all of these areas. Furthermore, Fiorano provided these features at an affordable price, allowing Flytxt to immediately deploy the solution across all of its Servers and know that extra capacity could be added whenever it was needed.
                </p>
                <p>Said Tom Jobbins, Flytxt's Core Services Manager: "Over and over, Fiorano's reliability and performance was highlighted by our study &ndash; it beat its rivals in every metric, and is proving as solid in production as it did in our tests. This coupled with its competitive pricing meant there was no competition &ndash; it had to be Fiorano."</p>
