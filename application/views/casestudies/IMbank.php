                <h4> Customer Profile</h4>


                <p>Kenya is fast developing into one of the largest
                    commercial banking markets on the African continent
                    where the financial sector is becoming substantial and
                    complex. With total assets exceeding US$1.57 billion,
                    I&M Bank is ranked as one of the top 10 banks in
                    Kenya. The bank is licensed by the Central Bank of
                    Kenya which is the central bank regulator as well as
                    the regulator for national Banking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&M Bank serves the banking needs of large and small
                    business customers as well as individuals, with
                    emphasis on large and medium-sized corporations. Its
                    product suite includes banking services, trade
                    services, foreign exchange, payment cards,
                    ecommerce, mobile banking, internet banking, ATMs,
                    agency banking and bank assurance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In February 2018, the bank launched a corporate
                    strategy dubbed “Imara”, for new customer value
                    propositions for its business segment. Kihara Maina,
                    I&M Bank CEO said that the move was in line with its
                    aspiration - “to become a banking powerhouse in East
                    Africa for middle to large businesses and premium
                    clients.”
                </p>
                <h4> Business Challenge</h4>
                <p>
                    I&M Bank had a complex IT
                    landscape with scores of Core and
                    Business Applications running on
                    HP, Oracle and Microsoft platforms together with a fully
                    redundant Disaster Recovery (DR) site. I&M Bank's
                    need for digital transformation arose from its new
                    strategy aimed at giving each market segment a
                    customized proposition to complement their lifestyle
                    and financial requirements. The use of multiple point-topoint
                    connections was impeding this goal due to its
                    rigidity, high maintenance and management costs. The
                    bank uses Finacle, the Core Banking System (CBS)
                    from Infosys, and required a flexible architecture to fast
                    track its Digital Roadmap as it was struggling to keep
                    pace with fast-changing business and customer needs.
                    The bank faced challenges posed by fluctuating delivery
                    times and increased costs due to the absence of an
                    agile customer facing environment.
                </p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    I&M Bank was looking for a platform to ease integration
                    between their diverse systems and applications.

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    I&M Bank evaluated several ESB vendors based on:

                </p>
                <p>
                <b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ease of Use</li>
                    <li>Speed to design and create new connections</li>
                    <li>Overall 5-year total cost of ownership (TCO)</li>
                    <li>Post Implementation Support</li>
                    <li>Scalability</li>
                    <li>Product Features</li>

                </ul>
                </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                     Fiorano ESB, offering a combination of high flexibility
                    with low resource consumption fared best on these
                    criteria as compared to other providers making it the
                    preferred choice as an ESB vendor for I&M Bank.
                </p><p>

                    The implementation took place in several phases. The
                    first phase for the Alternate Banking Channels was
                    completed in four months with an engagement from a
                    single bank resource. In the second phase, I&M Bank
                    moved other applications to Fiorano without any
                    engagement from the Fiorano team.
                </p>
                <p class="col-xs-12">
                    <img  src="<?php echo base_url('assets/images/casestudies/IM-Fiorano_flow.jpg')?>" class="img-responsive align-right col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As illustrated in the figure above, Fiorano ESB exposed
                    several of the I&M Bank's services such as:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Core Banking Transactions</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li> Balance inquiry</li>
                            <li>Funds transfer</li>
                            <li>Withdrawal</li>
                            <li> Deposit</li>
                            <li> Mini statement</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) services</li>
                    <li>SMS and ATM alert</li>
                    <li>IPRS (Integrated population registration system)</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These services are consumed by multiple peripheral
                    systems for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Agency Banking</li>
                        <li>Mobile Banking</li>
                        <li>Investment Banking</li>
                        <li>ATM</li>
                        <li>KITS - an interbank transfer switch provided</li>
                        <li>by KBA (Kenya Banker's Association)</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The distributed architecture of Fiorano allowed
                    seamless integration of these exposed services with
                    channel applications while messaging queuing took
                    care of guaranteed data delivery with message logging
                    and tracking systems. Messages routed via Fiorano are
                    now logged for auditing and tracking which enables the
                    IT team to rapidly perform root cause analysis of any
                    issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the initial implementation, Fiorano Senior
                    Solution Architects provided knowledge transfer
                    sessions to I&M Bank's IT team. These sessions
                    helped them work independently to integrate KITS (a
                    switch enabling interbank transfer of funds) with their
                    existing IT architecture. The IT team at I&M Bank, now
                    equipped with Fiorano, can handle all integration and
                    business flow creations themselves.

                <p><a href="<?php echo site_url('products/fiorano_integration')?>" target="_blank"> The Fiorano Integration Platform</a>
                    provides several powerful features
                    that make business process
                    automation simple and efficient.</p>
                <p>
                    <b> Core Banking Integration: </b>
                    Fiorano ESB effortlessly
                    integrates Core Banking applications with multiple
                    systems making Fiorano a fundamental part of the
                    Banking architecture. Fiorano's solution supports an
                    incremental deployment model, enabling modular and
                    standardized implementations with low risk and
                    expense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Peer-to-peer architecture: </b>
                    Fiorano's distributed peerto-
                    peer architecture linearly increases performance as it
                    supports in-built messaging at the end-points with a
                    direct end-to-end communication and enables parallel
                    data-flows. This provides the capability to handle the
                    increasing number of users with no degradation in
                    performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Increased Business Agility: </b>
                    Fiorano simplifies
                    application maintenance and new application
                    development, resulting in dramatically reduced likelihood
                    of outages.

                <p>
                <b> Significantly lower learning curve: </b>
                    Fiorano ESB  offers
                    a lower learning curve. Where it takes an engineer
                    almost six months to get productive on other systems, a
                    new un-trained resource can learn and become part of
                    the live Project team with Fiorano in just a week.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Reliability:  </b>
                    Absence of a single point of failure makes
                    the system inherently more robust and suitable to meet
                    the bank's high transactional volume and stress, without
                    fear of breakdowns.

                <h4>Result and Benefits</h4>
                <p>
                    <b>Expeditious launch of services: </b>
                    Fiorano provides a great level of
                    flexibility and agility to I&M Bank.
                    Integration changes in the form of totally new
                    integrations to third parties or a change to an existing
                    integration can be done quickly and without having to
                    go through extensive programming cycles. This
                    reduces project integration timelines and enables
                    I&M Bank to quickly adapt to market needs and
                    launch new services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Low Dependencies on External Vendors: </b>
                    Availability of multiple
                    <a href="<?php echo site_url('products/fiorano_microservices')?>" target="_blank"> Fiorano adaptors</a> simplifies the
                    integration process for all integration requirements.
                    The GUI based drag and drop design makes it easy
                    to use and implement new integrations. This helps in
                    significantly reducing the dependency on vendors for
                    integrating new applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Efficient issue escalation and resolution: </b>
                    In case
                    of a functional breakdown, the
                        Fiorano platform alerts
                    the functional team in real time, avoiding any
                    business disruptions and quickening the process of
                    issue escalation. The Document tracking (Message
                    logging) helps the IT team analyze and resolve
                    issues quickly with a significantly improved customer
                    response level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Improved bottom line: </b>
                     I&M Bank saved
                    significantly on development cost as Fiorano ESB is
                    a codeless integration platform. Fiorano ESB
                    obviated the need to invest in additional software
                    resulting in reduction of overall costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Faster response to internal business needs: </b>
                    The integration of new services and interfaces is
                    now handled independently by the IT team at I&M
                    Bank. Automatically configuring the underlying
                    middleware allows the logical process design to be
                    mapped directly to physical services distributed
                    across the ESB, empowering non-technical
                    business-users to compose, deploy and modify
