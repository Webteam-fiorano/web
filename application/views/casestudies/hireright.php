                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    Improving the consistency and the effectiveness of Customer Service was one of the top priorities for HireRight. The company decided to implement one of the leading, on-demand, CRM solutions. Providing tight and seamless integration between HireRight's internal systems and the new CRM was an essential component of a successful implementation. With Fiorano ESB, however, the integration's level-of-effort was significantly reduced, and was central in helping produce a deeply integrated business solution.
                </p>
                <p>Fiorano ESB is an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) middleware product from business process integration leader Fiorano Software Inc. With Fiorano ESB, companies can integrate a long list of otherwise incompatible applications and processes&ndash;from Web Services and .NET to Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), J2EE and legacy applications&ndash;using reliable, event-driven messaging based on a standardsbased Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).</p>
                <p>Standards supported by Fiorano ESB include SOAP, UDDI, HTTP, XML, JMS, J2EE, JDBS, BPEL4WS and many more. Because they are highly distributed within a company and with no single point of failure, ESBs are inherently reliable and highly scalable. What's more, they can be deployed from any physical location across a company's technology network.</p>
                <h4>Benefits</h4>
                <p>
                    Using Fiorano ESB, the HireRight development team was able to implement and deploy a working solution in a matter of weeks. The solution has enabled HireRight to deeply embed the CRM functionalities for case management and issue tracking inside their service delivery process. Hundreds of customer support cases are now processed daily, automatically, drastically reducing the processing time and cost required for dealing with customer interactions.
                </p>
                <p>HireRight's development staff was also impressed with the ease with which Fiorano ESB installed in HireRight's network, the short learning curve, the richness of prepackaged adapters, the unique debugging capabilities and, last but not least, with the Fiorano's customer support responsiveness.</p>
                <p>Due to our unique architecture and easy-to-use tools in our solution, the implementation was very quick and effortless. Unlike complex and expensive integration solutions, Fiorano's integration solution enabled HireRight to achieve immediate tangible benefits for delivering better service to its customers.</p>
