                <h4> Business Challenge</h4>
                <p>
                    Bajaj Finserv of fers an extensive range of loan and insurance products
                    and services to its customers. These services are hosted by disparate
                    applications at the Bajaj datacenter, connected via decentralized 'Point-to-Point'
                    interfaces using various customized interfaces. With the number of such
                    programmed interfaces increasing, the sheer volume was becoming unmanageable
                    requiring incremental resources with specialized skill sets to maintain. Some customer
                    account activities required tedious manual processes to update standard customer contact details, such as
                    address, telephone number, email address etc.
                    <br>
                    Apart from Kiosk operations, Bajaj Finserv uses FinnOne,
                    a loan management application, which keeps track of
                    customer accounts and maintains transactional data of
                    customer interactions. DataMart, a data warehouse
                    application populates data from FinnOne and
                    Salesforce.com applications which data is then used by
                    partner portals (that perform various actions including
                    Address verification) and by customer portals, allowing
                    customers to check their accounts

                    A burgeoning middle-class with high purchasing power
                    and the fast paced financial marketplace in India requires
                    quick and consistent communication between applications
                    so customers get updates in near real-time. While this was
                    a clear business goal, the slow and cumbersome business
                    applications framework compromised operational
                    efficiency with risk of frequent breakdowns. It was critical
                    for Bajaj Finserv to streamline ad revamp its business
                    processes. Requirements were broadly classified as:

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    After evaluating various vendors, Bajaj Finserv narrowed
                    down few vendors to conduct detailed proofs of concept.
                    Bajaj Finserv found that Fiorano SOA
                    platform will address
                    their business requirements in a faster and more efficient
                    manner; Fiorano's peer-to-peer architecture was a perfect
                    fit to overcome the growing business demands of a
                    financial service conglomerate like itself.
                    The solution was achieved by building various â€œFiorano flowsâ€� to address
                    each integration problem.
                </p><p>
                    The point-to-point connections of customized programmed
                    web-service interfaces, databases and similar integration
                    interfaces were replaced by designing Fiorano Event
                    Process flows with appropriate standards-based Fiorano
                    adapters and deploying these business flows on the plug-n-play Fiorano ESB platform in each case, allowing easier
                    maintenance and reconfiguration for all the interfaces.

                        using the Fiorano HTTP

                        directly connects to the Bajaj

                    Earlier customer account activities were being carried out
                    by making point-to-point connections between W
                    ebService
                    interfaces and databases using database procedure calls.
                    The total number of such programmed interfaces was
                    becoming too large to maintain and required extra
                    resources with specialized skills.
                    These flows involved:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                <li> Capturing customer leads from IVR
