                <h4> Business Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    Then the district government officers needed data from its controlled agencies and hospitals in the health sector for data analysis and generated reports, it took several days for its subordinated agencies to collect data from their systems and submitted their reports in different formats. These data reports then had to be assembled manually, and it turned out to be a tedious work and also easily causing errors. In an emergent disease crisis, the government requires prompt data reports to make critical decisions.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem with the current manual data collecting process and report generation process caused the delay for decision making which might affected the district government operations.
