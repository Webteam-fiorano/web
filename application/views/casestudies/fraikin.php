                    Fiorano SOA powers electronic traffic fine management and inventory management for French logistics giant, Fraikin
                </h3>

                <hr>
                <h4>Business Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    Fraikin, being a leading vehicle fleet service provider in Europe, has a
                    fleet of 40,000 vehicles running on the roads of France. With such a large fleet on road, incidents of traffic violation are not uncommon.
                    The traffic fines, including parking fines and speeding fines, issued to
                    Fraikin are to the extent of 12,000 fine tickets per year. </p>
                <p>
                    Until recently, before the computerization of the fine management
                    system, the fine tickets were sent to Fraikin by post. On receipt of
                    fine tickets by Fraikin, they used the details of fine tickets to
                    manually search the clients' credentials for the hired vehicles, and
                    the fine tickets were sent to them.</p>
                <p>
                    With the implementation of an electronic system of fine management by
                    the Government of France, Fraikin was given a set of specifications to
                    develop an application to facilitate electronic communication between
                    the logistics giant and the Government. The government specifications
                    included mandatory communication of Fraikin's fleet to the Government
                    twice a year, communication of Fraikin's fleet modification every week
                    and quick processing of traffic penalties or fines. The biggest
                    challenge for Fraikin was to build a rapidly deployable integrated
                    platform, which would meet all the requirements specified by the
                    government. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 padding-top-20">
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>Fraikin has a multi-platform environment including Windows machines and
                    an IBM z/OS mainframe Main client records and vehicles records are stored in the mainframe DB2 database. In order to build a scalable
                    integration platform and to leverage on  existing hardware,
                    Fraikin decided to deploy Fiorano Middleware Platform SOA.</p>
                <p>Fraikin used the Fiorano Platform to develop a series of event processes to exchange and process traffic fines.</p>

                <strong class="b">Event Process Flow 1</strong>: The first
                process flow was constructed to enable communication of Fraikin's fleet
                to the French police, twice a year. This process converts the flat file
                provided by the mainframe into an XML file, which is verified against
                the government specified schema. If the file is correct and error-free,
                it is sent to government records via FTP.</p>
                <p><strong class="b">Event Process Flow 2</strong>: An event
                    process flow was built to meet the government requirement of
                    communication of fleet modification every week. This event process is
                    similar to the first flow, except its frequency is weekly. These
                    flows help the French Police keep records of the vehicle fleet of the
                    largest logistics services company in Europe.</p>
                <p><strong class="b">Event Process Flow 3</strong>: An event
                    flow was built to receive fine notifications by the French Traffic
                    Authority. This flow retrieves and processes the XML file sent by the
                    French Police on a daily basis. This XML file is split into messages
                    and each message becomes a Web Service request sent to the mainframe,
                    where the DB2 database is updated.</p>
                <p><strong class="b">Event Process Flow 4</strong>: Another
                    process flow was constructed to facilitate Fraikin's response to the
                    government, communicating the credentials of the companies hiring
                    Fraikin's fleet at the time of penalty. This flow is a continuation of
                    the previous flow, which extracts the information to every demand, as
                    updated on the DB2. A flat file with responses to the demands sent by
                    French Police are being written by the mainframe, and this flat file is
                    being converted to XML, which is then submitted to the Police via FTP.</p>
                <p><strong class="b">Event Process Flow 5</strong>: An event
                    process was created to manage errors in reporting. There have been
                    incidences of rejection of responses by Fraikin, sent in event process
                    4. In such cases, the event process 5 receives the errors and processes
                    them. </p>

                        fleet at the time of traffic violation.</li>

                <h4>Business Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    Fraikin operates over 220 integrated service facilities across Europe
                    and uses the Fiorano SOA Platform, to manage its complex warehouse
                    inventory across these locations. With parts information and inventory
                    levels changing with every purchase / usage at various warehouses
                    spread across different geographic locations, the challenge lies in
                    effectively updating and maintaining stock of hundreds of these parts.
                    With various legacy systems already in place, there was a strong need
                    for a flexible, versatile integration platform that would encompass the
                    existing legacy applications and provide an easy means of access to
                    these for newer technologies. </p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    Fiorano SOA platform with its diverse set of adapters is being used to
                    unify and merge data from different sources and formats into  one
                    unified repository. The data (as raw text) across different transports
                    including emails, flat files over FTP, shared file systems are culled
                    into the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), converted to appropriate formats
                    using the powerful set of transformation adapters and routed to
                    appropriate data channels. Fraikin's existing legacy applications are
                    integrated into this platform and exposed to the standards gateway using Fiorano's
                    standard based pre-build adapters. This lets Fraikin's partner and
                    service facility applications to co-exist with the legacy
                    applications. </p>
