                    Beijing Water Management Bureau improves water plant management with Fiorano Integration
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <h4> Business Problem</h4>
                <p>The Beijing Water Management Bureau wanted to build a central database to host its large data used in the silos of many applications and heterogeneous databases of its subordinate agencies. The goal is to exchange data with the center database and increase data-sharing between applications. The problem with decentralized database structure in the organization is that it is difficult for sharing data between the different applications thus hinders further application development. Similarly,
                    processing requisitions and purchase orders often, therefore, required managers to log into three or four different systems to initiate approvals.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 padding-top-20">
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    The proposed solution was to build a central database and used Fiorano technology for exchanging data between the heterogeneous databases. Fiorano's solution provides Real-Time information about plant operations at the click of a mouse including the means to access archival data.
                    Departments saves time and money by consolidating systems management and eliminating redundant applications.

                <h4>Why Fiorano</h4>
                <p>The value of the solution is to have easier change management, secure and reliable data exchange, easier deployment of new data and exchange processes and easier to integrate more heterogeneous database systems. By adopting Fiorano technology, the data was exchanged Real-Time with the central database for application development.
                    Fiorano SOA platform is a future-proof solution that leads to saving time, reducing effort and creating flexibility for the customer.</p>
