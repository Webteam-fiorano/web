                <h4>Customer Profile</h4>
                <p>Connect First is a leading provider of hosted call center solutions.  The Connect First platform provides a complete suite of bundled telephony services including inbound ACD, outbound predictive dialing, call tracking and IVR.</p>
                <h4>Business Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    The Connect First platform was in the processing of being restructured.  One of the areas being re-developed required high speed, high throughput messaging in a highly available model.  At its core, the Connect First platform processes telephone calls, so speed and guaranteed delivery of mission critical messaging was absolutely critical to the solution.</p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    Connect First implemented the Fiorano Messaging Queue to solve the requirements for high performance inter server/process messaging. The FioranoMQ Server was deployed in High Availability mode to help achieve the 99.999% uptime guarantee given to clients.
