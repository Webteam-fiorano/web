            <h4> Business Problem</h4>
            <p>
                Zunyi is a small city in the mountain area of Guizhou province in the southwest of China mainland. Zunyi is famous in the Chinese revolutionary history due to the"Zunyi Meeting" held in 1935 by the Red Army on the famous Long March, in which Chairman Mao's leadership position in the Red Army was recognized.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the city's economy is falling far behind those cities in the coastal areas of China, Zunyi's government decided to start its e-government initiative for the goal of more opening government to attract more investments into the poor region. The problem for the city government's website was that some information data for publishing on the website didn't get updated quickly and had to be done manually by copying data between the internal database and the external database serving the internet publics across a firewall. Copying data manually between databases caused the delay of information got published and data errors introduced by human operations.

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    The proposed solution is to exchange data between the two databases across the firewall and have the public needed information got published on the website in a real-time and automatic manner.
                </p>
