                    Fiorano Helps Gamma-Dynacare for Quick and Accurate Reporting of Medical Tests
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <h4>Customer Profile</h4>
                <p>
                    Gamma-Dynacare ("Dynacare"), one of Canada's largest and most respected providers of medical laboratory services and solutions, supports patients, healthcare professionals and public and private sector clients with the efficient collection and transportation of specimens, accurate testing in state-of-the-art laboratories and prompt reporting of results.
                 </p>
                 <p>                   
                    With more than 50 years of experience, its clients include 10 million patients, more than 15,000 healthcare professionals, governments, regional health authorities, hospitals, long-term care facilities, clinical trial sponsors, employers, insurers and other laboratories. It operates five laboratories in Ontario and 200 Patient Service centers across Canada. Through a nation- wide mobile collection and transportation network, Gamma-Dynacare offers coast-to-coast services to clients and the healthcare industry.
                </p>
                <h4>Business Problem</h4>
                <p>With 50 million tests conducted each year and serving more than 15,000
                    Canadian clinicians and other
                    healthcare providers, Gamma-Dynacare is focused on continuously building the experience of its customers. A key aspect of this service is timely, accurate and enhanced reporting.
                </p>
                <p>Reducing time, achieving near 100% accuracy in matching test results and automating its processes was crucial for Gamma-Dynacare by way of helping patients seek immediate attention by their healthcare provider. With a rapidly
                    expanding and disparate client base, it also had a need to accelerate the business, and in particular, the development and rollout of new products and services.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 padding-top-20">
                <h4>Solution</h4>
               	<p>After a detailed evaluation, Gamma-Dynacare chose Fiorano over other software providers based upon the Fiorano Platform's productivity, innovation and rapid deployment, compressing time to market. With Fiorano's efficient mapping tools and ESB infrastructure, the time taken to deliver test results was significantly reduced, resulting in a notable increase in customer satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Gamma Dynacare deployed <a href="<?php echo site_url('/products/fiorano_esb')?>">Fiorano ESB</a> for swift and accurate testing and reporting of tens of thousands of specimens each day. Fiorano has played a pivotal role in allowing Gamma-Dynacare to digitize, transform and transmit high volumes of complex data to multiple end-points and partners.</p>
                <p><a href="<?php echo site_url('architecture/fiorano_microservices'); ?>">Fioranos Microservices architecture</a> supports an incremental deployment model, enabling deployments to be more modular and standardized, with lower risk and expense. Fiorano ESB incorporates proven enterprise architecture, service delivery, deployable business functionality and an integrated portfolio
                    of Microservice-centric business services transforming the enterprise architecture into a horizontal, closely integrated core system to accommodate free flow of data.
                </p>
                <p>Unlike the traditional approaches, Fiorano allows Gamma
                    Dynacare staff in IT or business to perform lightweight,
                    self-service data and application integration, where "Citizen Integrators" can visually assemble instantly running solutions by drawing application and service nodes on a canvas
                    through drag-and-drop of active Fiorano Microservice components. The lines between nodes comprise event flows via active message pipelines, collectively representing a user- defined event-driven architecture. The visual model is the ready-to-run, fully implemented application, with no additional programming required.
                </p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 padding-top-20">
                <h4>Results</h4>
                <p>With an innovative enterprise system in place, Gamma- Dynacare was able to automate multiple processes:</p>
                <ul class="pad">
                    <li>Automate interface between core lab system and ERP system at GDML (Gamma Dynacare Medical Laboratories).</li>
                    <li>Automate interface between HR ERP and vendor learning portal.</li>
                    <li>Automate orders-out interface to partner vendors using HL7.</li>
                    <li>Automate results-in interfaces from partner vendors using HL7 with embedded PDF.</li>
                    <li>Provide web-services for vendor party integration into their application, enabling the vendor product to interface into GDML's ordering system and validate and retrieve order information.</li>
                    <li>Automate interface between core lab system and vendor partner system.</li>
                    <li>Distribute reports automatically from vendor system to GDML systems.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Gamma-Dynacare uses Fiorano for reporting a number of critical and complex tests, including the Food Intolerance
                    Test; This test measures over 220 specific foods at a time and involved manual processing together with a tedious and
                    critical task of matching lab test results with patients and patient records, a process that was taking upwards of 3 days per patient.
                </p>
                <p>With Fiorano's efficient mapping tools and ESB infrastructure, the time taken to deliver test results was reduced to less than two hours, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and a significant ROI.</p>
